<h2> MyTodo App </h2>

<p align="center">

</p>

MyTodo is a simple, interactive to-do list web application that allows users to manage their daily tasks. Users can add tasks, categorize them by labels such as "Work," "Home," "Shopping," or "Urgent," and mark them as done once completed.

<h2 id="UX">User Experience (UX)</h2>

MyTodo is designed with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The user interface is intuitive, ensuring that users can quickly add, view, and manage tasks without any unnecessary steps.

Clean Design: The app features a clean, minimalist design with a dark color scheme that is easy on the eyes. The consistent use of the "Lilita One" font adds a playful and modern feel.

Responsive Layout: The app is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices. The layout adjusts seamlessly, ensuring that all functionalities are easily accessible regardless of the device used.

Interactive Elements: Visual feedback is provided for interactive elements. For example, when a task is marked as complete, the task's appearance changes, making it clear that the task is done. The use of icons and color changes helps users quickly identify different actions.

Form Interaction: The form fields are designed to be user-friendly, with clear placeholders and focus effects that guide the user through the task creation process.

Error Handling: The app includes basic error handling to prevent users from scheduling overlapping tasks. If a time conflict occurs, the user is immediately notified, allowing them to choose a different time.

Task Prioritization: By allowing users to categorize tasks by labels, MyTodo helps users prioritize their tasks visually, making it easier to focus on what matters most.
